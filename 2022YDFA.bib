  abstract = {Photodarkening in Yb doped fibers was examined at 633 nm insitu during cladding pumping at 915 nm with varying pump powers and with no indication of an onset threshold. For the first time, the partial bleaching of the photodarkening loss by the pump power itself was observed. We found the relaxation to well-defined equilibrium states of the core excess loss, depending on the Yb inversion. From the dependence of the measured rate constant on the density of excited Yb ions we conclude, that on average 3 to 4 excited Yb ions create or bleach one color center responsible for the core excess loss.},

This is achieved using an ultra large-mode-area rod-type photonic crystal fiber pumped at 915 nm. To the best of our knowledge this is the highest output power close to diffraction-limited beam quality (M2 about 2.2) achieved in this wavelength range from fibers so far .The experimental results are supported by detailed numerical simulations that provide a deeper understanding of the laser process, in particular the competition with the 1030 nm emission.},

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis of Raman and thermal effects in kilowatt ytterbium-doped double-clad (YDDC) fiber lasers is presented. Solutions to suppress these detrimental effects in the YDDC fiber lasers under bidirectional end pump and distributed pump are discussed. The quantitative analysis shows that the Raman effects can be suppressed by using large-mode-area fibers, shortening the cavity length, adopting a longer lasing wavelength, and reducing reflections at the Raman\textendash Stokes wavelengths; and the thermal effects can be effectively eliminated by utilizing the distributed pump and optimizing the arrangement of pump powers, pump absorption coefficients, and fiber lengths.},
