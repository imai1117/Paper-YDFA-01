  abstract = {Photodarkening in Yb doped fibers was examined at 633 nm insitu during cladding pumping at 915 nm with varying pump powers and with no indication of an onset threshold. For the first time, the partial bleaching of the photodarkening loss by the pump power itself was observed. We found the relaxation to well-defined equilibrium states of the core excess loss, depending on the Yb inversion. From the dependence of the measured rate constant on the density of excited Yb ions we conclude, that on average 3 to 4 excited Yb ions create or bleach one color center responsible for the core excess loss.},

  abstract = {The ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier offers a number of attractive features, including a broad-gain bandwidth and a high efficiency, due in large part to its freedom from various competing processes seen in other rare-earth dopants. Here we discuss the main features that influence design and possible applications of ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.},
