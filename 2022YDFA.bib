If this technology is to be introduced in the future optical fiber networks, this implies that most of the optical components of the transmission line, including the popular Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that lie at the heart of fiber communications need to be reexamined. This study reviews the way the new generation of Erbium-doped fibers affects the recent findings on few-mode fibers and how they may further play a central role in the deployment of this technology.},

After observing degradation in high vacuum, we can recover the fluoride and oxide optics with oxygen; however, this recovery process becomes ineffective after several applications. For the fluoride optics, we see that initial UV conditioning in an oxygen environment helps to improve the performances of the optics. In oxygen-rich environments from {$\sim$}10-4 mbar, the fluoride optics can stably maintain up to 20 W of intracavity power on several-hour time scales whereas for the oxide optics there is immediate degradation with a rate that increases with decreasing oxygen pressure.},

Excitation into the CT-absorption band generates similar color centers as observed in ytterbium-doped fiber lasers under 915nm high power diode pumping. The position of the CT-absorption band is compositional dependent and is shifted to shorter wavelengths in ytterbium doped phosphosilicate glass. Very low levels of photodarkening is observed for the ytterbium doped phosphosilicate glass composition under 915nm high power diode pumping.

In the 20/400-\textmu m deuterium pre-loaded Ybdoped fiber, an output laser power of 1630 W and beam quality factor (M2) of 1.69 were obtained.
