  abstract = {Space-division multiplexing has brought a fresh perspective to the optical fiber community over the last three years and many global players around the world have been involved with both the theoretical and the experimental questions raised by this promising approach. If this technology is to be introduced in the future optical fiber networks, this implies that most of the optical components of the transmission line, including the popular Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that lie at the heart of fiber communications need to be reexamined. This study reviews the way the new generation of Erbium-doped fibers affects the recent findings on few-mode fibers and how they may further play a central role in the deployment of this technology.},

Compared to conventional fiber amplifiers, which are typically pumped at shorter wavelength, the single-stage gain of the amplifier is increased to more than 20 dB and the ASE level is reduced by an order of magnitude. Frequency doubling in a PPLN waveguide produces light at 556 nm, which is used to capture Yb atoms in a magneto-optical trap on the 1S0\textrightarrow{} 3P1 intercombination line.},

For the first time, the partial bleaching of the photodarkening loss by the pump power itself was observed. We found the relaxation to well-defined equilibrium states of the core excess loss, depending on the Yb inversion. From the dependence of the measured rate constant on the density of excited Yb ions we conclude, that on average 3 to 4 excited Yb ions create or bleach one color center responsible for the core excess loss.},

  abstract = {We have discovered that in ytterbium-doped silica fibres of different compositions the excited state lifetime of a fraction of the Yb ions (between 1\% and over 90\%) is quenched to a very small value, leading to a strong unbleachable loss. This unexpected behaviour seems to be caused by a yet unidentified impurity or structural defect, probably a colour centre. It can seriously degrade the performance of Yb-doped lasers and amplifiers (including Er:Yb codoped fibres as used in telecommunication amplifiers), especially if the pump or signal wavelength is around 976 nm. Fibres with a low level of quenching exist, but it is not yet understood which precautions have to be taken to guarantee successful production.},

Solutions to suppress these detrimental effects in the YDDC fiber lasers under bidirectional end pump and distributed pump are discussed. The quantitative analysis shows that the Raman effects can be suppressed by using large-mode-area fibers, shortening the cavity length, adopting a longer lasing wavelength, and reducing reflections at the Raman\textendash Stokes wavelengths; and the thermal effects can be effectively eliminated by utilizing the distributed pump and optimizing the arrangement of pump powers, pump absorption coefficients, and fiber lengths.},
