本誌では976nmと1112nmのファイバアンプの開発と実験結果の数式シミュレーションとの比較について報告する。

The high-power and compact systems are used in laser processing, long-distance optical communication relays, and LiDAR systems.
In physics, highly stable doped fiber systems are attracting attention as a basic light source for optical frequency comb and spectroscopy.
Although there are still some problems, such as photo-darkening, that are not fully understood, remarkable progress has been made in their performance.
The 976-nm and 1112-nm lasers using Yb-doped fiber are also promising light sources for physics experiments.
However, their design is difficult because one wavelength is in the middle of the absorption band and the other is at the edge of the emission band.
Therefore, mathematical simulations are indispensable.
In this issue, we report on the development of fiber amplifiers for 976 nm and 1112 nm and the comparison of experimental results with mathematical simulations.

This section is devoted to provide a more quantitative discussion of the competing emissions at 980nm and 1030 nm under 915 nm pumping.
Following ref. [2], the undesired gain at 1030 nm can be expressed in terms of the gain at two other wavelengths, namely the wavelength of maximum emission cross-section (975 nm) and the pump wavelength (915 nm).
Using the cross-sections given in [2], the expression becomes (in decibels) G1030 = 0.25G975 + 0.72βαP, where β approximately equals the ratio of pump core area to effective mode field area of the laser mode (Aclad/Aeff) and αP denotes the pump absorption.
In a typical double clad fiber suitable for high power operation the pump and signal core sizes are 30 µm and 250 µm respectively; this gives a value of β near 70.
Thus, leaving the contribution of the laser gain G975 aside, it can be seen that for every decibel in pump absorption the gain at 1030 nm increases ~50 dB. This strong gain increase implies that the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) will dominate the emission even for 1 dB (20%) pump absorption.
Therefore, in this type of fiber it is not possible to obtain an efficient laser operation at 980 nm.

The Yb-doped fiber(nLIGHT Yb1200-10/125DC) is used as a gain fiber.
The length of the Yb-doped fiber is about \SI{1?}{m}.
The output from Yb-doped fiber is separated into \SI{1112}{\nm} signal component and ASE component around \SI{1030}{\nm} by WDM, and only the \SI{1112}{\nm} signal component is coupled to the the second amplifier stage.
The second Yb-doped fiber is the same one of the first Yb-doped fiber.
The about \SI{3?}{m} long doped fiber is coiled to a diameter of \SI{10}{\cm} and fixed inside an aluminum enclosure with thermal conductive sheet.
Temperature of the aluminum enclosure is controlled by peltier devices.
Output of the second Yb-doped fiber is removed by CPS and collimated by pigtailed collimator.

\section{Yb-doped fiber amplifier}
In developing fiber amplifiers, it is important to keep the undesired gain as low as possible.
Gain at ASE wavelength can be written as a function of gains at two other wavelengths \cite{nilsson1998ringdoped}.
In the cases of amplified signal at \SI{976}{nm} with \SI{915}{nm} pumping, and amplified signal \SI{1112}{nm} with \SI{976}{nm} pumping, gain of ASE which has center wavelength of \SI{1023}{nm} can be expressed using the cross section in Fig.~\ref{fig:EnergylevelAndCrosssectionOfYb3+} as follows
\begin{align}
  G_{1023} &= 0.29\cdot G_{976} + 0.96\cdot \beta A_{915} \label{Eq:976YDFAGain}\\
  G_{1023} &= 6.5\cdot G_{1112} + 0.027\cdot \beta A_{976}, \label{Eq:1112YDFAGain}
\end{align}
where $G_{\lambda}$ is gain at wavelength $\lambda$, $A_{\lambda}$ is absorption of the pump at $\lambda$, and $\beta$ is the ratio of pump propagation area to effective modal field area of \SI{1023}{nm} ASE.
For the \SI{976}{nm} YDFA, as shown in Eq.~\eqref{Eq:976YDFAGain}, a smaller value of $\beta$ is necessary to suppress the ASE gain.
In our \SI{976}{nm} system, we use Yb-doped fiber with core and cladding diameters of \SI{20}{\um} and \SI{125}{\um}, respectively, which has a relatively small $\beta \simeq 61$ in commercially available Yb-doped LMA fibers.
Without consideration of the gain at \SI{976}{nm}, the ASE gain increases $\sim \SI{59}{\dB}$ for each \SI{1}{\dB} of \SI{915}{nm} pump absorption.
The above result indicates that it is important for \SI{976}{nm} YDFA to control \SI{915}{nm} pump absorption by using relative short Yb-doped fiber and to reduce input components to amplifier near ASE wavelength.
On the other hand, for the \SI{1112}{nm} system, pump absorption has less contribution to the ASE gain $G_{1023}$.
Therefore, we use Yb-doped LMA fiber with a core diameter of \SI{10}{\um} and a cladding diameter of \SI{125}{\um}, which has a more single-mode characteristic than that used for \SI{976}{nm} system.

For more detailed estimation for YDFA, numerical simulations are required.
We developed the simulation code based on the model in \cite{roeser200894}.
The simulations for forward and backward propagating pump, signal, and ASE were conducted according to the rate equation given by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    N &= N_{1} + N_{2}\\
    \dv{N_{2}}{t} &= \frac{1}{A_{core}} (\sigma_{a}(\lambda_{p})N_{1} - \sigma_{e}(\lambda_{p})N_{2}) \frac{\lambda_{p}}{hc}\Gamma_{p} (P^{+}_{p} + P^{-}_{p})\\
    &+ \frac{1}{A_{core}} (\sigma_{a}(\lambda_{s})N_{1} - \sigma_{e}(\lambda_{s})N_{2}) \frac{\lambda_{s}}{hc}\Gamma_{s} (P^{+}_{s} + P^{-}_{s})\\
    &+ \frac{1}{A_{core}} (\sigma_{a}(\lambda_{a})N_{1} - \sigma_{e}(\lambda_{a})N_{2}) \frac{\lambda_{a}}{hc}\Gamma_{a} (P^{+}_{a} + P^{-}_{a}) - \frac{N_{2}}{\tau},
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:RateEquation}
\end{equation} \todo{rewrite equations later}
and propagation equations in fiber are described as
\begin{align}
  \dv{P^{\pm}_{p}}{z} &= \pm\Gamma_{p}P^{\pm}_{p}(\sigma_{e}(\lambda_{p})N_{2} - \sigma_{a}(\lambda_{p})N_{1}) \mp \alpha P^{\pm}_{p} \label{eq:PumpPropagationEquation}\\
  \dv{P^{\pm}_{s}}{z} &= \pm\Gamma_{s}P^{\pm}_{s}(\sigma_{e}(\lambda_{s})N_{2} - \sigma_{a}(\lambda_{s})N_{1}) \mp \alpha P^{\pm}_{s} \label{eq:SignalPropagationEquation}\\
  \dv{P^{\pm}_{a}}{z} &= \pm\Gamma_{a}P^{\pm}_{a}(\sigma_{e}(\lambda_{a})N_{2} - \sigma_{a}(\lambda_{a})N_{1}) \mp \alpha P^{\pm}_{a} \pm 2\sigma_{e}(\lambda_{a})N_{2}\frac{hc^{2}}{\lambda_{a}^{3}}\Delta\lambda_{a}. \label{eq:ASEPropagationEquation}
\end{align}
Here $N$ is the Yb-ion concentration, $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the population densities of the ground and excited state, respectively.
$\Gamma_{i} (i = p, s, a)$ is the overlapping factors for pump, signal, and ASE relative to the doped area, $A_{core}$ is the area of the doped area, $P^{\pm}_{i} (i = p, s, a)$ is the pump, signal, and ASE power, whose symbol $\pm$ corresponds to forward(+) and backward(-) propagation.
